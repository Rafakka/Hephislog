## 🔄 HEPHISLOG FLOW

<br>

This directory documents domain-specific processing flows in HEPHISLOG.

Each flow represents a deterministic pipeline composed of isolated agents,
schema contracts, and event-driven orchestration.

Flow are documented to preserve architectural intent and prevent knowledge loss as the system evolves.
